# General Guidelines for Master's and PhD Students

## 1. Literature

Staying on top of the relevant literature is essential for any research project:

- **Responsibility**: You are expected to actively monitor the state-of-the-art in your area
- **Avoid redundancy**: Familiarize yourself with existing work to ensure your project is novel
- **Communication**: Share interesting papers with the group
- **Summarize**: When possible, summarize main results with bullet points to spark discussion
- **Google Scholar Alerts**: Set up alerts for keywords and authors relevant to your field ([Guide](https://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=175947&p=1158942))
- **Reference Manager**: Use tools like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to organize references and export BibTeX entries directly to Overleaf
- **Journal Clubs**: Consider forming small groups to review papers informally
- **Skimming ToCs**: Skim table of contents from key journals

## 2. Wellness, Work Hours, and Expectations

- **Work-Life Balance**: Flexibility in academia is a feature—use it wisely. Overwork ≠ productivity
- **Remote Work**: Most tasks (e.g., writing, reading, coding) can be done remotely
- **Core Hours**: Aim to be in the office from 10–5 for collaboration and social interaction
- **Workload**: No expectation to work evenings/weekends
- **Rhythms**: Expect ups and downs. Take breaks when needed and communicate proactively
- **Extracurriculars**: Encouraged if not significantly affecting research—discuss in advance
- **Support Resources**:
  - [MIT HR Center for WorkLife and WellBeing](https://hr.mit.edu/worklife/center)
  - [MIT GradSupport](https://oge.mit.edu/development/gradsupport/)
  - [MIT Disability and Access Services](https://studentlife.mit.edu/das)
  - [MIT HR Disability Services](https://hr.mit.edu/disability-services)
- **Sick Days**: Prioritize health, always

## 3. Holidays and Vacation

- **Take Your Time Off**: Fully use your entitled vacation and institute holidays
- **Notification**: Inform me in advance if you are not going to be around for whatever reason
- **Conference Travel**: You're encouraged to extend conferences with vacation if feasible

## 4. Defining Research Projects

- **Collaborative Approach**: Projects are co-designed based on your skills and interests
- **Balance**: Assess novelty, risk, and impact
- **Decision Gates**: Use go/no-go milestones to steer project directions
- **Goal Setting**:
  - Short-term: achievable within weeks/months
  - Long-term: achievable over semesters
  - Visionary: dream-level (5–20 year) impact framing
- **Publication Path**: Each project should have a clear motivation and audience
- **Efficient Use of Time**: Prioritize projects with the potential for meaningful impact
- **Collaborations**: Strongly encouraged both within and beyond the lab
- **Funding Constraints**: Be aware that grant deliverables may shape your project direction
- **Literature Deep Dives**: Crucial for framing and scoping a successful project
- **Project Selection Philosophy**: See [Michael Fischbach on Choosing Problems](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900304-0)

## 5. Documenting Work

- **Why**: Proper documentation supports reproducibility, collaboration, and eventual publications or patents
- **Format**: Use any system (physical or electronic) that works, but ensure it is backed up and accessible
  - Preferred: Electronic notebooks (e.g., OneNote, Notion)
  - Backup: Dropbox (MIT license), GitHub, local NAS
- **Version Control**: Use private GitHub repos for all code-based projects
- **Storage**: Maintain multiple copies of large datasets. NAS, external drives, or cloud cold storage are options
- **File Naming Convention**: Use: `YYYY MM DD <Name>` or `YYYY MM DD HH mm <Name>` for frequent drafts
- **Further Reading**: [How to Record Research Notes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4565690/)
