# General Guidelines for Master's and PhD Students

## 1. Principles

Science is supposed to be demanding and hard, but also exciting and fun. If you only feel the bad parts, something is not right and we should fix it. 

- **Supportive Environment**: Aim to create a positive workplace that supports everyone's professional and personal goals
- **Diversity & Inclusion**: Excellence is independent of background; diverse perspectives in gender, race, ethnicity, orientation, economic status, and other identities are essential for innovation and community wellbeing
- **Addressing Bias**: Everyone has implicit biases that can cause unintentional harm; we must acknowledge them, work to correct them, and be willing to admit mistakes
- **Direct Communication**: Group members are encouraged to discuss concerns privately with me, and I will always try my best to listen empathetically

## 2. Wellness, Work Hours, and Expectations

Sombody once said that researchers have total flexibility to choose which 60 hours of the week they want to work. Of course, this is a joke (at least for me!), but flexibility can indeed be a blessing or a curse. Some pointers:

- **Work-Life Balance**: Flexibility in academia is a feature — use it wisely (overwork ≠ productivity)
- **Remote Work**: Most tasks (e.g., writing, reading, coding) can be done remotely and/or asynchronously, and you can and should use this to your advantage
- **Core Hours**: Aim to be in the office from 9–5 for collaboration and social interaction, otherwise you will miss a lot of the fun
- **Workload**: No expectation to work evenings/weekends, if you feel like you *have* to, we need to discuss
- **Rhythms**: Expect ups and downs depending on deadlines, take breaks when needed and communicate proactively
- **Support Resources**: 
  - [Effective equality platform](https://intranet.csic.es/igualdad)
  - [Human resources help](https://intranet.csic.es/procedimientos_prl)
- **Sick Days**: Prioritize health, always

## 3. Holidays and Vacation

As above, working longer hours or without a break is probably not very efficient for anyone. Science is hard work and most people are able to do just a few hours of mentally demanding work per day. Luckily, there is always some other boring, crappy thing to do for a few more hours. My advice is to try and make those few hours that matter really effective, so:

- **Take Your Time Off**: Fully use your entitled vacation and institute holidays
- **Notification**: Inform me in advance if you are not going to be around for whatever reason
- **Conference Travel**: You're encouraged to extend conferences with vacation if feasible

## 4. Defining Research Projects

A PhD is not a sequential set of tasks that must be completed in order. However, funding often works that way. You will normally have a main project that will be co-designed based on your skills and interests (and the available funding constraints). If you want to bring up some side-project, here are some pointers:

- **Balance**: Assess novelty, risk, and impact
- **Decision Gates**: Use go/no-go milestones to steer project directions
- **Goal Setting**:
  - Short-term: achievable within weeks/months
  - Long-term: achievable over semesters
  - Visionary: dream-level (5–20 year) impact framing
- **Publication Path**: Each project should have a clear motivation and audience
- **Efficient Use of Time**: Prioritize projects with the potential for meaningful impact
- **Collaborations**: Strongly encouraged both within and beyond the lab
- **Literature Deep Dives**: Crucial for framing and scoping a successful project
- **Project Selection Philosophy**: See [Michael Fischbach on Choosing Problems](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2824%2900304-0)

## 5. Documenting Work

We must adhere to the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) principles in our research. Documenting what we do and how we do it is part of it. If done smartly, it does not take much time!

- **Why**: Proper documentation supports reproducibility, collaboration, and eventual publications or patents
- **Format**: Use electronic notebooks (e.g., OneNote, Notion)
- **Backup**: [SACO CSIC](https://saco.csic.es/login) (100 Gb), other cloud storage providers, GitHub, local NAS
- **Version Control**: Use private GitHub repos for all code-based projects
- **File Naming Convention**: Use: `YYYY MM DD <Name>` or `YYYY MM DD HH mm <Name>` for frequent drafts
- **Further Reading**: [How to Record Research Notes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4565690/)

## 6. Literature

Staying on top of the relevant literature is essential for any research project:

- **Responsibility**: You are expected to actively monitor the state-of-the-art in your area
- **Avoid redundancy**: Familiarize yourself with existing work to ensure your project is novel
- **Communication**: Share interesting papers with the group
- **Summarize**: When possible, summarize main results with bullet points to spark discussion
- **Google Scholar Alerts**: Set up alerts for keywords and authors relevant to your field ([Guide](https://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=175947&p=1158942))
- **Reference Manager**: Use tools like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to organize references and export BibTeX entries directly to Overleaf
- **Journal Clubs**: Consider forming small groups to review papers informally
- **Skimming ToCs**: Skim table of contents from key journals
