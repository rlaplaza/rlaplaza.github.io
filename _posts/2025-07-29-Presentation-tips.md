# Scientific Presentation Guidelines

## About

This document aims to help you create effective **slides for scientific communication**, suitable for conferences, thesis defenses, candidacy exams, and other academic presentations. We cover the **basics**, offer **tips and tricks**, and end with a **comprehensive checklist** you should review **systematically and carefully** before presenting.

You’re encouraged to discuss your presentation’s **content and structure** with senior lab members or your supervisor once you’ve implemented these fundamentals. Doing so saves everyone time and enhances the quality of feedback.

## Basics

### Template

Using a clean, consistent **template** will save you time and improve clarity. If your institution provides templates, start there (check your department or lab resources). Otherwise, consult **prior presentations** from colleagues in your group or create a clean, minimalist layout yourself.

- Example templates: [Google Slides templates](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/), [Canva academic templates](https://www.canva.com/presentations/templates/education/), [Overleaf Beamer Templates](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/presentation)
- Don’t reinvent the wheel — reuse and improve!

### Font

Stick to **one sans serif font** throughout (e.g., **Arial**, **Calibri**, or **Helvetica**). Fonts should be **large and readable** — minimum 18–20 pt for text. Maintain **consistent font sizes and styles** (e.g., if your slide titles are bold 36 pt, make them all that size).

Use the same font style within **figures and diagrams** to maintain cohesion.

### Color

Use color to **guide attention**, not decorate. Choose a consistent **color scheme** (e.g., red for drawbacks, green for advantages) and **stick to it throughout**.

- Explore color palettes with [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) or [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create)
- Ensure your palette is **colorblind-friendly**: [Color Universal Design (CUD)](https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/) or [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/)

### Bullets

Bullets organize content visually, but they must be used carefully:

- Don’t use bullets if there's only **one point**.
- Don’t mix **different types of information** in a single bulleted list.
- Adjust **bullet spacing** (default spacing is often too wide).

### Animations

Only use **simple appear/disappear animations** to reveal content progressively. This helps reduce cognitive overload and keeps your audience focused.

- Avoid distracting transitions (spins, fly-ins, etc.).
- Match your **spoken flow** to your animations.

## Tips and Tricks

### Be Structured

Use **consistent titles and headers**. Include **visible slide numbers** to help viewers follow along or jot down questions.

Make it clear whether a slide represents:
- Background info
- Previous work
- Your contribution
- Ongoing/future work

### Be Consistent

Consistency enhances clarity. Double-check:
- Fonts, colors, and text sizes
- Slide layout and figure styles
- Terminology and abbreviations

Avoid changing the meaning of colors (e.g., don’t represent the same method in red on one slide and blue on another).

### Be Clear

Less is more. Use **short sentences**, and **simple phrasing**. Try adding **“take-home messages”** at the bottom of each slide.

- General rule: **1 slide per minute** of talk.
- Speak slowly and enunciate.
- Prioritize clarity over quantity.

### Be Scientific

Maintain rigor:
- Support all claims with references.
- Label all figures clearly.
- Introduce abbreviations before use.
- Avoid cluttered or context-less plots.

The goal isn’t to impress with complexity but to **communicate your work effectively and maturely**.

### Be a Storyteller

Don’t list results — **tell a story**:
- Frame your work as a **logical narrative**.
- Connect each slide with cause/consequence logic.
- Use transitions that **bridge one idea to the next**.
- Consider using a **visual summary** or diagram to orient the audience.

## Final Checklist

Before you present or seek feedback, **go through this checklist carefully**. Most first drafts can be improved substantially.

### ✅ Structure and Clarity

- Can a distracted viewer understand the current slide if they just woke up mid-talk?
- Is the font readable from the back of the room?
- Are slide numbers visible?

### ✅ Consistency

- Are fonts, font sizes, colors, and layouts **uniform**?
- Are texts, headers, and columns **aligned**?

### ✅ References

Follow a consistent citation style (e.g., [ACS](https://pubs.acs.org/page/4authors/submission/acs_style_guide.html), [IEEE](https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/create-your-ieee-article/use-authoring-tools-and-ieee-article-templates/ieee-reference-guide/), or [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/)). I like shortened ACS style, for example:

- Gallarati, S.; Laplaza, R.; Corminboeuf, C. *Org. Chem. Front.* **2022**, *9*, 4041.
- Aspuru-Guzik, A. *et al.* *ACS Cent. Sci.* **2018**, *4*, 268.

Use tools like:
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
- [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)
- [BibGuru](https://www.bibguru.com/)
- [EndNote](https://endnote.com/)
